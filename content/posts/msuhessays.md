# What job do you hope a college education will prepare you for?  What job would you pursueif you had guaranteed wealth for the rest of your life?  If the two jobs are not the same,explain why you think thereâ€™s a difference

I am hoping that college will prepare me for either a career in Systems Engineering or Computer science.  However if financial concerns were not an issue I would probably become a full time Climate Change Activist. 

Its actualy been a topic that I have been split on for a while, in an ideal world I would probably just get a STEM job and be done with it, however I have this responsibility that isnt easy to ignore. Climate change is an issue that can be pushed to the side in favor of more important issues. Its one of these things that requires the combined effort of humanity to solve to avoid catastrophic impacts for the future.

My involvement in the our childrens trust case has often had me choose between what I would like to do, or whats needed for a stable career, and the Juliana v. US lawsuit. Its one of those issues that I have never quite resolved.

Climate change is one of these issues that impacts young pepole disproportinatly over older generations. I will be living with the impacts of climate change for the rest of my life. And yet despite the fact that me and my other plantiffs (as well as all future generations), havent gotten a say in the last 50 years of governmental policy that have excaserbated the climate crisis.

Its one of these issues that I wouldnt be working on if it wasnt for the severity and urgency of the issues that we face. We have about a decade left to completely decarbonize the entire economy or face serious consequences. 

# What are your three favorite books and what do they say about you?
*Will reformulate into one essay tommorrow*

I think its also intresting that my 3 favorite books are all nonfiction. And I think it probably comes down to my favorite John Green quote *"Books of ideas are only as good as the ideas contained within."*. To me, all fiction needs to have its basis rooted in reality. I have found the impulse to use fantasy as escapism from reality to be almost 


### Nature's Trust
This book is very personaly important to me because its the inspiration for the lawsuit that me and 20 other young pepole are bringing against the trump administration. 

It brings forward the idea that the government has this inalienable responsibility to care for the enviorment under its contry. And that this right can not be given away. It suggests using this argument to build a constitutional lawsuit, using the public trust argument to say that the government has a constitutional responsibility to fix the climate crisis.


### Reinventing Fire

What I realy like about this book is that it realy changed the way I had viewed my main area of climate change activism. It transformed the whole issue from a vauge "Transition/Revolution", into a conciveable way to decarbonize the entire economy. Its a lot more hopeful then a lot of other books about similar issues.

I also had read it at a very important time for me personaly. I had read a lot of think-peices saying that climate change was this massive unsolvable issue, that fundamentaly renewable energy was just way to expensive to practicaly ever replace coal and natrual gas for electricity generation. And it showed that with only minor programs like carbon taxes and some other legeslation we could transform the entire economy. Its one of the things responsible for making my entire outlook on climate change more positive.


### Infinite Series

I had originaly bought this book by the recommendation of a youtuber that I liked. I think this book is the final piece that pushed me into wanting to study math.

When I had taken differential equations at Bear Creek, I had struggled a lot with some of the conceptual results, I had bought this book halfway through the semester, and it realy reignited my love of math at a time when I was feeling quite discouraged.

Its one of those books that can be read by someone with no math experience and still get a lot out of it. For me it served as a reminder of why math is beautiful, and at its core is fundamentaly a peice of beauty,.
