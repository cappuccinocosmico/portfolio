# What job do you hope a college education will prepare you for?  What job would you pursueif you had guaranteed wealth for the rest of your life?  If the two jobs are not the same,explain why you think thereâ€™s a difference

I am hoping that college will prepare me for either a career in Systems Engineering or Computer science.  However if financial concerns were not an issue I would probably become a full time Climate Change Activist.

### Infinite Series
